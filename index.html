      <h1>Even Joseph Vela</h1>
      <p>Hi! I recently graduated from Los Angeles Pierce College, Woodland Hills, and I am transferring to California State University, Northridge. I am an outgoing conformist person that enjoys solving problems methodically. Working together in a team is where I thrive most. I am usually the person that will come up with all test scenarios and ensure that the application or setup is fool-prove. I have done programming from low level Assembly all the way up to Java Android application and doing desktop support all the way up to setting up network security. My most recent passion has been working with desktop support and network security.</p>
      <p>After a long and busy day studying and working with computers, I enjoy meeting up with my online friends and grind my War Thunder game. I have been doing this for the last 6 years, but because of my other responsibilities, I am not as far along as I wished. As a form of exercise, I am pursuing my 4th Dan Black Belt in Taekwondo. I have been doing this since I was in elementary school. As you can see, my sedulous attitude has kept me pursuing my interest. With others, I enjoy having deep discussions in just about any topic. My favorite ones include current events and life in general. This gives me a glimpse of how someone thinks, and I am always curious of the way people think.</p>
